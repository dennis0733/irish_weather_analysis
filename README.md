# Irish Weather Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
An in-depth exploratory data analysis of Irish weather data from Met Eireann, covering daily meteorological measurements across multiple weather stations.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Met Eireann (Ireland's Meteorological Service)
- **Time Period**: January 2018 - December 2019
- **Coverage**: 2 years of daily recordings

## Weather Measurements
- Maximum air temperature
- Minimum air temperature
- Precipitation amount
- Mean wind speed
- Highest wind gust
- Hours of sunlight

## Stations Analyzed
- Dublin Airport
- Shannon Airport
- Cork Airport

## Key Analysis Techniques
- Descriptive statistics
- Histogram visualization
- Correlation analysis
- Comparative station analysis
- Temperature range calculations

## Insights Generated
- Temperature distribution patterns
- Precipitation variability
- Wind speed characteristics
- Sunlight hours across seasons
- Inter-station weather comparisons

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run Jupyter Notebook

## Limitations
- Limited to 2-year period
- Focuses on physicochemical measurements
- Some missing data points

## Future Work
- Extended time series analysis
- More advanced statistical modeling
- Climate trend investigations
